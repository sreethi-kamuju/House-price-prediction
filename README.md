# Introduction
Welcome to my first machine learning attempt. The main goal of this is to predict prices through use of machine learning techniques. I went through a simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset and built three different models. I now want to compare them and identify the best performing one in prediction.
# Tools used
+ Google Collab
+ Jupyter Notebook
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
At first, I explored dataset thoroughly in order to get an in-depth understanding of what it was all about. This entailed analyzing data distributions, spotting outlying points in it, filling up blanks as well as generating charts of critical developments. EDA was very pivotal as far as guiding subsequent model decisions while acquiring a total comprehension for the information involved.
# Model Comparison
The three machine learning models that I implemented for this project were Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor. My basis for selecting each model was its appropriateness for the task as well as its capability to capture underlying data patterns. I went on to train and assess each by comparing their performance metrics and understanding how good they were at predicting prices.
# Results
I found that Random Forest Regressor is the most accurate way to predict prices after comparing. Its performance measures indicate better ability to capture underlying patterns on dataset such as After Cross Validation with 200 rmse calculated then wat the mean and std of these rmseâ€™s. This will be our ultimate selection into price forecasting from all models we considered for this task.
# Future Steps
There is always room for improvement in my first machine learning project. I will explore more feature engineering techniques, try different models and further optimize selected model to improve its predictive accuracy.
# Conclusion
To sum up, I am a machine learning beginner because of this assignment. I looked into the data with exploratory data analysis (EDA) as well as by comparing models, it has helped me discerning various ways in which prices may change at different times as well as pointing out which model is consistent enough when it comes to forecasting price changes. This knowledge will form the basis of my future work on machine learning.
